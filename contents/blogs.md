   Short term trading that involves entering and exiting positions on the same day - within 24 hrs. You take advantage of price moves that happen within a trading day.
   Day traders use price action and technical analysis to execute trades.

3. Trend Trading

- Involve holding positions for long. Trader can long on a down trend or vice versa. Also know as Position trading. It incorporates moving averages, trend-lines, and other technical indicators. History of asset pair plays a big role here.

4. Scalping.
   My favorite üî•.
   One of the quickest trading strategies. Scalpers focus on small price moves over and over again.
   Scalpers don't hold positions for long time - entries and exits happen in seconds. It is more of High Frequency trading(HFT). Exploitation of bid-ask spreads, gaps in liquidity, and other market inefficiencies.
   Mostly recommended for whales - large traders, due to small percentage of profits, so trading large positions makes reasonable profits.

### Passive Trading strategies.

1. Buy and Hold

- Buying and selling assets with the hope of making a profit in the long run. Entry is based on fundamental analysis. Hold On Dear Life (HODL) Phenomenon is the buy and sell strategy. The HODL strategy may not be suitable for other cryptocurrencies especially volatile ones.

2. Index Investing

   Index Investing is buying ETFs and Indices in traditional markets.The idea is to create a basket of cryto-assets and create a token that tracks their combined performance. The basket could be of coins from similar sector or privacy coins or utility tokens with reliable price feeds.
